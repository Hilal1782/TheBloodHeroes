										<p>It gives me an immense pleasure to have made it to this higher platform. Aim drives you through various stages and conditions in life. Serving humanity is my aim. It guided me into social works and, after circulating me in different other organizations and societies, brightened up my day by driving me to join The Blood Heroes in 2020, a blood welfare society which had recently pledged to reach out to all those who were longing for blood in the COVID crisis. And thus I followed my aim from working as a member with TBH through being a graphic designer at district level, at provincial level, at National level and all the way up to Media Head at National level.</p>
										<p>My journey with TBH reinforced my enthusiasm for serving humanity. It reinforced my belief that the only way to satisfaction is serving the humanity and that being of service to others is what brings true happiness.</p>
										<p>I suggest the youth to take active part in volunteerism because youth is the best time to serve humanity. Help others help others help others because no one has made it through life without someone else's help.</p> 
										<p>"Only a life lived in service to others is a life worth living."</p>
