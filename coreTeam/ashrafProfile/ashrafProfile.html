										<p>I joined this wonderful team named 'The Blood Heroes' as a Twitter handler and Records Team member. It never occured to me that I'd be working with this team actively in the long run.</p>
										<p>My experience in TBH is ull of ups and downs. I've been with TBH in all sorts of good and bad, I have experienced the worst days as well the days in which TBH was praised on National Level, achieving milestone after milestone.</p>
										<p>I am currently proud to lead and represent a team that has proven to be the pivotal point in the time of crisis known to be called covid, a team that provided a big number of donors/blood to the patients in need. My Provincial team has also remained the most active one even on-ground activities (150+) just this year; for which I want to thank every member who contributes their best for this good cause without expecting anything in return.</p>
