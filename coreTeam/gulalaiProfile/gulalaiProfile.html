										<p>Have you ever heard of 'a dream come true'? This is rare right and only few people can achieve their dreams! That's what TBH is, My Dream! and yes I can proudly say that I am one of those luckiest people whose dreams come true.</p>
										<p>When we started this campaign with the help of few volunteers, I couldn't even imagine coming this far. All we had in our mind was a 3 weeks social media awareness campaign! But who could imagine at that time that this initiative will turn into a 'Blood Society', having volunteers from almost all the regions of Pakistan working together as a team to save innocent lives, working 24/7 just to serve humanity and getting nothing materialistic in return but the precious gift of contentment and satisfaction in this world and ajar for Akhirah! All this was beyond imagination, but when you are determined and focused on your goals and want to do something good, something noble, Allah Almighty will help you definitely and make all impossible turn into possibles. I couldn't imagine achieving this without the support of my dedicated members. The soul and real power of TBH is our BLOOD HEROES!</p>
