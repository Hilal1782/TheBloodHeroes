										<p>"-and whoever saves a life, it will be as if they saved all of humanity" 5:32. This verse from the holy Quran is the reason I became a part of this campaign.</p>
										<p>When the world shutdown and pandemonium ensued, then came a group of students who took initiative to be the light of the people who had been reduced to helplessness at hands of lack of blood donations. Little did they know within a few months they would be a nationalcampaign, that has come to changing the public perspective about blood donation. We have become the closest knit community of community welfare, we work and help like a family moreover there is something for everyone in our campaign. This is all due credit to our amazing team, which day and night strives to serve the community with absolutely no material gain. Having said that, this is truly the very example of the youth of our country. I pray we all continue on our path and change the community for the better.</p>
